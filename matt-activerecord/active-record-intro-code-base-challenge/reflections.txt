Active Record makes working with and handling databases a more seamless
experience with Ruby. We are able to run commands that mimic SQL queries to
create, read, update, and delete from databases directly with Ruby.

Although it is a bit confusing at the moment with all the new commands, as
someone who learns by doing, I hope it will come to me more naturally as I
continue to work with Active Record.
